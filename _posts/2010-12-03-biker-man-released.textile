Our latest single "Biker Man" is now out. You can get it "from us directly":http://music.krylls.com/track/biker-man for the low price of $1 or "from iTunes":http://itunes.apple.com/us/album/biker-man-single/id407583598 for the even lower price of $0.99. That extra penny to us gets you much higher quality download options than are available from iTunes.

"Biker Man" is the soundtrack to our first profesh video, directed by Mr. Michael Beach Nichols. The lyrics were written by Mr. Cary Beckwith as a theme song for the M. Anshluss Bike Gang. Cary and Josh began playing a game of sending each other lyrics to already-written songs, then writing new music. Hopefully you can hear the full set of double songs, including Cary's sweetened version of the Krylls song "Dark Horse," in 2011. "Biker Man" was recorded by Sean in our practice space in the same session as "Reconquista."
