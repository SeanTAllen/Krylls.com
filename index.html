<p>Welcome to the online home of Krylls. We’re a Brooklyn, NY, punk rock band that has been around since 2004. If you want to know what we sound like, you can listen to any of our recordings at the music tab above.</p>

<p>We are extremely serious about our work. Extremely. When we say we boogie, we mean we circumrotate our gluteus maximi until they get so big and bruised that we look like pairs of purple armadillos from behind. When we say we shred, we mean we make Kip Winger look like a sixth-grader plucking out &ldquo;Come As You Are&rdquo; with his thumbs.</p>

<p>We are what is known in the business of rock as a &ldquo;power trio.&rdquo; On the four skins we have Basque-core vet Iñaki Domench. On the bass and vox there’s the Jedi wannabe Josh Garrett-Davis. And on guitar and vox is Mr. Medicine Ball Sean Allen. That’s all.</p>

<p>Write us at <a href="mailto:krylls@krylls.com">krylls@krylls.com</a> if you want us to play your dungeon party or quinceañera.</p>
